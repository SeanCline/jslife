Conway's Game of Life in Javascript
===================================

I threw this together several years ago to test out the new (at the time) HTML5 2D canvas.

It supports changing game speed, seeding with random data, interaction with mouse, and loading demos of some common sprites.

### [Live Demo](https://rawgithub.com/SeanCline/jslife/master/life.html)

The web has changed quite a bit since I put this demo together. Sometime, I'd like to speed it up using WebGL (3D canvas) for drawing and typed arrays for grid computation. Or, if feeling really adventurous, maybe a pixel shader for computation as well.
